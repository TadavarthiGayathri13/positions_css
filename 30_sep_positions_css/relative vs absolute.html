    <h1>Difference between relative and absolute positioning</h1>
           <h2><u>Reference Point:</u></h2>
           <b>●Absolute Positioning:</b> Elements with absolute positioning are positioned relative 
            to the nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor that is not static) or the initial 
            containing block (the viewport if there is no positioned ancestor).<br>
            <b>●Relative Positioning:</b>Elements with relative positioning are positioned relative 
            to their normal position in the document flow. The positioning is relative to the 
            element's normal position.
            <h2><u >Document Flow:</u></h2>
        <b>●Absolute Positioning:</b> Elements with absolute positioning are taken out of the
             normal document flow. Other elements act as if the absolutely positioned element doesn't exist.<br>
            <b>  ●Relative Positioning:</b> Elements with relative positioning still occupy space in
             the normal document flow. The space they would have occupied before positioning is preserved.
            <h2><u> Effect on Siblings:</u></h2>
        <b> ●Absolute Positioning:</b> Absolutely positioned elements can overlap with other elements,
             and they are not affected by the presence of siblings.<br>
            <b> ●Relative Positioning:</b> The space reserved for the element is still maintained in the
             document flow, affecting the positioning of subsequent elements.
